## Description

I created this application to allow a user to manage their staff. A user can view all of their employees, departments, roles, and managers. They can also add new employees, departments, and roles and update existing employee roles for when they get promoted. The technlogies that were used for this application were MySQL, Express, Node.js, and Javascript. This application can only run in the terminal.
